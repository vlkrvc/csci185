										<h3>History of motorsport</h3>
										<p>The modern era of Formula One began in 1950, but the roots of Grand Prix racing are far earlier, tracing to the pioneering road races in France in the 1890s, through the Edwardian years, the bleak twenties, the German domination of the 1930s and the early post-war years of Italian supremacy</p>
										<p>The first race using the appellation “Grand Prix” was 1901’s French Grand Prix at Le Mans, won by Ferencz Szisz with a Renault, who covered the 700 miles at 63.0 mph.</p>
										<p>During World War I, racing was halted in Europe, and many drivers participated in the U.S. Indianapolis 500. Enzo Ferrari — who’s real fame was to follow as a team manager and manufacturer with Scuderia Ferrari, formed in 1929 to race Alfa Roméo P2s — finished second in the 1920 Voiturette race at Le Mans, the first international road race in France in six years.</p>
										<p>But in 1934, the balance of power in racing would begin to shift from Italy to Germany, Germany 38with the emergence of factory teams from Auto Union (now Audi) and Mercedes-Benz, behind massive financial support from the Third Reich government on orders from Adolph Hitler</p>
										<h3>History continues to develop.</h3>
										<p>And so, as they have for seven decades, the young men and old masters of Formula One move forward into a new season in which every driver and car are still competitive for the championship before the first GP — reaching for laurels, Mumm and money, but mostly for the almost-mythical reverence attached to the title of world’s best driver. The glamour, history, passion and breathtaking performance of F1, that 70-year, globe-circling odyssey to determine the true World Champion of motorsports, will be renewed once again. New legends will be made, egos bruised and engineers challenged. But that has always been the saga of Formula One.</p>

											<h3>Decades of development</h3>
											<p>Throughout the decades, motorsport was always improving, starting with supercharged italian/german front-engine cars, continuing later with British independent specialists with rear-mid engine cars, development and usage of technoligies to improve aerodynamics. Years of development led us to our era, era of less than 2 litres, turbocharged engines. </p>

											<h3>Mercedes AMG Petronas</h3>
											<p>In 1894, the world’s first car race was held from Paris to Rouen and the winning machine had at its heart an engine manufactured to the design of Gottlieb Daimler, also known as the founder of Mercedes-Benz. And now Mercedes AMG Petronas celebrates 127th anniversary of being in motorsport, and being one of the best racing teams nowadays.</p>
